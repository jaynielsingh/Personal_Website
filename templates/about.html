                <p style="font-size: medium;">A self taught python developer with an interest in making web apps.
                  My Journey started after i was laid off during the pandemic. Since i always had an interest with
                  computers and how they work,
                  i decided to take the leap. While i've came this far, there is still more to learn and better hone my
                  skills.</p>
